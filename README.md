# Improved Arm Joint Design with FEA Considerations

This project presents an improved mechanical joint design for a robotic arm, with the goal of enhancing durability and stiffness while maintaining key dimensions.

## 🔧 Original Dimensions (from drawing)
- Base diameter: 45 mm
- Arm height: 29 mm
- Distance between arms: 54 mm
- Arm thickness (original): 4.5 mm

## ✅ Improvements Made
- Arm thickness increased to 6 mm for better strength
- Added fillets at critical corners to reduce stress concentration
- Ribs added between arm and base for additional stiffness
- Symmetrical hole placements for uniform load distribution
- STL model ready for simulation and 3D printing

## 📁 Files Included
- `improved_joint.stl`: The final STL model
- `design_image.png`: Rendered 3D preview of the improved joint
- `README.md`: Project explanation and improvement notes

## 🧪 Recommended FEA Simulation Setup
- Fixed support on the bottom face of the base
- Apply a 10N load at the top arm edge
- Analyze stress and displacement
